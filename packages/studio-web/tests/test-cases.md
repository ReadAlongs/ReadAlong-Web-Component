# Test cases for end-to-end testing of the ReadAlong Studio-Web Studio and Editor

Global setting: make sure analytics is disable, stubbed out, or sent to a fake
server, so we don't generate bogus traffic.

## Story 1: main walk through the Studio

### Fill in Step 1

- Launch Studio.
  - Expect it is loaded.
- Enter this text in the text box.

### Download formats

  - Expect download1 matches RE `sentence-paragr-[0-9]*.html`
  - TODO validate the contents, somehow
- Select Web Bundle output format
- Click on the download button
  - Expect a file download to happen
- Let download2 = name of that downloaded zip file.

  - Expect download2 matches RE `sentence-paragr-[0-9]*.zip`
  - Expect download2 contents to look like this:

        $ unzip -l sentence-paragr-20241023184608.zip
        Archive:  sentence-paragr-20241023184608.zip
        Length      Date    Time    Name
        ---------  ---------- -----   ----
                0  2024-10-23 18:46   www/

            26277  2024-10-23 18:46   www/assets/sentence-paragr-20241023184608.wav
             2023  2024-10-23 18:46   www/assets/image-sentence-paragr-20241023184608-1.png
               45  2024-10-23 18:46   www/sentence-paragr-20241023184608.txt
             1749  2024-10-23 18:46   www/assets/sentence-paragr-20241023184608.readalong
             1378  2024-10-23 18:46   www/index.html
             1750  2024-10-23 18:46   www/readme.txt
        ---------                     -------
           898845                     10 files

    We can't check this exactly, but maybe all the filenames, and some contents:

    - `Offline-HTML/sentence-paragr-<date>.html` is identical to download1.
    - `www/assets/image-sentence-paragr-<date>-1.png` is identical to `page1.png`.
    - `www/assets/sentence-paragr-<date>.wav` is identical to `test-sentence-paragraph-page-56k.mp3`.
    - `www/index.html` is identical to `ref/www/index.html` except for the
      dates, and we'll want soft updating the version number so we don't have to
      change the ref files for each version bump
    - `www/readme.txt` is identical to `ref/www/readme.txt` modulo date and version number.
    - `www/sentence-paragr-<date>.txt` is identical to `ref/www/sentence-paragr-date.txt`.
    - `www/assets/sentence-paragr-<date>.readalong` is identical to
      `ref/www/assets/sentence-paragr-date.readalong` modulo date (for the
      .png file) and time= and dur= values for each word. And maybe get the
      read-along version number from config and studio-cli version number too,
      so the test doesn't fail whenever those get bumped.

- For each of the other four download format:
  - select it
  - click download
  - check the download contents against the matching file in `ref`.
    - Note: those files are all called `readalong.<ext>`, should probably also be `<title>-<date>.<ext>` (#366)

## Story 4: Analytics

Question: can we stub analytics? I'd like to detect that analytics work without
causing events to be send to Plausible. Maybe we can give it a bogus hostname
and track network traffic? We really don't want these tests to trigger traffic
on Plausible!

  - Expect Title and Subtitle to still be "foo" and "bar".

## Story 6: click around the Editor

- Load the Editor

- Load download1

- In the Audio Toolbar, click on Zoom + twice

  - Expect a zoomed in view showing a shorter duration than the whole

- click on the Zoom - five times (three times is enough on a large screen)

## Notes and Questions

I assume the web-component testing already verifies play/pause/back 5 sec,
etc, so I'm not covering them here.

Q: Does the web-c testing already test the gear menu for setting My Preferences?
That also doesn't really belong here, but needs to happen somewhere.
